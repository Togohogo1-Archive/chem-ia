# Chem IA
IB SL Chemistry Internal Assessment written in LaTeX

### Notes
- If any changes are made to the `.tex` file, the submitted version can be found [here](https://github.com/Togohogo1-Archive/chem-ia/tree/bfd3f8caae9ef53fb14fbef3946d3bf861beea6f).
- Other files such as raw exported data, spreadsheets, are not included in this repo.

### Workspace Settings in `.vscode/settings.json`
- Compiling with `-xelatex` prevents errors caused by Unicode characters.
- The option `-outdir=%DIR%/out/` used with the setting `latex-workshop.latex.outDir": "%DIR%/out/` is required for LaTeX Workshop to output and find project files in `./out/`.
